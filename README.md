# Twitter_Following_Ratios
I used a combination of R and Google Sheets to export the accounts I followed and get a better understanding of the voices I hear.

# Disclaimer:
This a very roundabout way to analyze twitter data, however it worked for me. I would like to find a way to directly import twitter data into R rather than go through the google sheets method.
