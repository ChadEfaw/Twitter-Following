# Twitter Following Ratios
I used R to export the accounts I followed and get a better understanding of the voices I hear on Twitter

## Disclaimer:

This code is not perfect and the data to predict off of is not perfect. There will be inaccuracies and misses due to a number of reasons. I will continue working on a solution that is more rigorous and inclusive. 

This code is a work in progress and so am I.  

## Goal:
I wanted to see how many different voices I heard while on social media. Looking at your bookshelf or film collection is an easy way to see the diversity and scope of the media you consume. Twitter, however, is a little more difficult. Hopefully this will help people increase the scale and scope of voices they listen to while online. 

## Function:
This code will import twitter data into R and then clean and calculcate the ratio of female accounts to male accounts. 

Thanks,
Chad
