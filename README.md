# Twitter Following Ratios
I used a combination of R and Google Sheets to export the accounts I followed and get a better understanding of the voices I hear on Twitter

## Disclaimer:
This a very roundabout way to analyze twitter data, however it worked for me. I would like to find a way to directly import twitter data into R rather than go through the google sheets method. 

This code is a work in progress. I will add in code to remove punctuation. Removing organization accounts might be cause for the user themselves to remove, rather than with code. 

## Goal:
I wanted to see how many different voices I heard while on social media. Looking at your bookshelf or blu-ray collection is an easy way to see the diversity and scope of the media you consume. Twitter, however, is a little more difficult. Hopefully this will help people increase the scale and scope of voices they listen to while online.
