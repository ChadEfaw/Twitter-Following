# Twitter Following Ratios
I used a combination of R and Google Sheets to export the accounts I followed and get a better understanding of the voices I hear on Twitter

## Disclaimer:
This a very roundabout way to analyze twitter data, however it worked for me. I would like to find a way to directly import twitter data into R rather than go through the google sheets method. 

This code is a work in progress. I will add in code to remove punctuation. Removing organizational accounts that get counted one way or the other might need the user themselves to filter out.  

This code is not perfect and the data to predict off of is not perfect. There will be inaccuracies and misses due to a number of reasons. I will continue working on a solution that is more rigorous and inclusive. 

## Goal:
I wanted to see how many different voices I heard while on social media. Looking at your bookshelf or film collection is an easy way to see the diversity and scope of the media you consume. Twitter, however, is a little more difficult. Hopefully this will help people increase the scale and scope of voices they listen to while online. 

## Function:
This code will import twitter data into R and then clean and calculcate the ratio of female accounts to male accounts. 

Thanks,
Chad
